<h2>Who Are We?</h2>

		Formed from the <?php echo $this->get('right[merging]', 'Merging') ?> of two separate meetups <em>(one by
		<a href="http://bokardo.com"><b><?php echo $this->get('right[name]') ?></b></a> and
		<a href="http://nerd.metrocat.org/">Jeff Watkins</a>
		and the other by <a href="http://blog.bos.genotrope.com/">Tom Summit</a>)</em>
		in early 2008, North Shore Web Geeks is a monthly
		meetup for web folks north of Boston, MA.
	</p>
	<p>
		We get together on the third Thursday of every month to
		hang out and chat about all things web, from Facebook
		to standards compliance, startups to Apple and
		everything in between.
	</p>
	<p>
		Our meetups attract all sorts of people from the web
		community including developers, designers, managers,
		SEO specialists, agency folk, freelancers, and startupers.
